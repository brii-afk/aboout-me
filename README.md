Future potiental ethical hacker !! 🖥👩🏻‍💻

Hii, I am currently a Secondary 5 student studying in Singapore. Although I may not have extensive coding experience, I am actively working to adapt to the coding world by dedicating my free time to learning and experimenting with code. My interest in coding was sparked when i discovered my problem-solving skills and my ability to break down complex concepts into simpler explanations, a skill I believe is invaluable in the field of technology :) I hope to contribute to the world meaningfully as a software developer or an ethical hacker.
